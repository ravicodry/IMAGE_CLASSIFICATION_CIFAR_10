## IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION on CIFAR-10

Project Idea 4: Natural Image Classification:

Introduction:This project is about the image classification problem.Our goal is to find the category of the given image.

Dataset:The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.

Goal: To implement various ML and Deep learning models studied in the course and check the performance of the model on the given dataset.
Also tried to find which  model is better for this dataset
